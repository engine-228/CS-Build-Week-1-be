    f"A tall granite door in a grim woods marks the entrance to this dungeon. Beyond the granite door lies a modest, crumbling room. It's covered in moss, bat droppings and dead insects. Your torch allows you to see rows of statues, destroyed and taken by time itself.",

    f"Further ahead are three paths, you take the left. Its twisted trail leads passed lost treasuries, unknown rooms and armories and soon you enter a shady area. It's packed with boxes full of runes and magical equipment, as well as skeletons. What happened in this place?",

    f"You press onwards, deeper into the dungeon's depths. You pass a few more rooms and passages, some are dead ends, others seem to have no end at all. You eventually make it to what is likely the final room. A big granite door blocks your path. Various odd symbols are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements. You step closer to inspect it and.. wait.. you hear a faint laugh coming from behind the door.",

    f"A small worn statue in a shady thicket marks the entrance to this dungeon. Beyond the worn statue lies a small, clammy room. It's covered in roots, dead insects and moss. Your torch allows you to see broken cages and torture devices,frayed and wrecked by time itself.",

    f"Further ahead are three paths, you take the left. Its twisted trail leads passed countless other pathways and soon you enter a humid area. An altar in the center is covered in runes, some of which are glowing. What happened in this place?",

    f"You advance carefully onwards, deeper into the dungeon's shadows. You pass many rooms and passages, some look awfully familiar, others stranger everything else. You eventually make it to what is likely the final room. A massive metal door blocks your path. Countless runes are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements. You step closer to inspect it and.. wait.. you think you can hear a whisper coming from behind the door.",

    f"A massive pair of granite doors in a bleak grove marks the entrance to this dungeon. Beyond the pair of granite doors lies a small, damp room. It's covered in small bones, roots and broken stone. Your torch allows you to see remnants of statues, destroyed and devoured by time itself.",

    f"Further ahead are three paths, you take the right. Its twisted trail leads passed countless other pathways and soon you enter a clammy area. It's filled with tombs, but their owners are spread across the floor. What happened in this place?",

    f"You press onwards, deeper into the dungeon's darkness. You pass many different passages, each with their own twists, turns and destinations. You eventually make it to what is likely the final room. A tall metal door blocks your path. Strange writing is all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements. You step closer to inspect it and.. wait.. you think you can hear a whisper coming from behind the door.",

    f"Further ahead is a single path. Its twisted trail leads passed pillaged rooms and soon you enter a dusty area. It's filled with strange glowing crystals and countless dead vermin. What happened in this place?"

    f"A small worn statue in a shady thicket marks the entrance to this dungeon. Beyond the worn statue lies a small, clammy room. It's covered in roots, dead insects and moss. Your torch allows you to see broken cages and torture devices,frayed and wrecked by time itself.",

    f"Further ahead are three paths, you take the left. Its twisted trail leads passed countless other pathways and soon you enter a humid area. An altar in the center is covered in runes, some of which are glowing. What happened in this place?",

    f"You advance carefully onwards, deeper into the dungeon's shadows. You pass many rooms and passages, some look awfully familiar, others stranger everything else. You eventually make it to what is likely the final room. A massive metal door blocks your path. Countless runes are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements. You step closer to inspect it and.. wait.. you think you can hear a whisper coming from behind the door.",

    f"A massive pair of granite doors in a bleak grove marks the entrance to this dungeon. Beyond the pair of granite doors lies a small, damp room. It's covered in small bones, roots and broken stone. Your torch allows you to see remnants of statues, destroyed and devoured by time itself.",

    f"You press onwards, deeper into the dungeon's darkness. You pass many different passages, each with their own twists, turns and destinations.

You step closer to inspect it and.. wait.. you think you can hear a whisper coming from behind the door.",

    f"Further ahead is a single path. Its twisted trail leads passed pillaged rooms and soon you enter a dusty area. It's filled with strange glowing crystals and countless dead vermin. What happened in this place?"
    f"Further ahead are three paths, you take the left. Its twisted trail leads passed lost treasuries, unknown rooms and armories and soon you enter a shady area. It's packed with boxes full of runes and magical equipment, as well as skeletons. What happened in this place?",

    f"You press onwards, deeper into the dungeon's depths. You pass a few more rooms and passages, some are dead ends, others seem to have no end at all. You eventually make it to what is likely the final room. A big granite door blocks your path. Various odd symbols are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements.
